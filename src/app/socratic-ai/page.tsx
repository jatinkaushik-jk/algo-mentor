                  üß† What is Socratic Learning?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The <strong>Socratic method</strong> is a form of learning
                  based on asking and answering thought-provoking questions.
                  Rather than providing direct answers, it encourages learners
                  to think critically and reason out solutions themselves. This
                  method:

                  <li>
                    Strengthens problem-solving and analytical thinking skills.
                  </li>
                  <li>Encourages curiosity and active participation.</li>

                  üí° How AlgoMentor Uses Socratic AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>AlgoMentor</strong> integrates the Socratic technique
                  using AI-powered conversations tailored for Data Structures
                  and Algorithms (DSA). Here‚Äôs how:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                  <li>
                    When you select an algorithm, the AI mentor initiates a
                    dialogue with a simple question instead of a lecture.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Based on your responses, it guides you through logical
                    steps, asking targeted questions to reinforce core concepts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The conversation adapts to your level of
                    understanding‚Äîoffering deeper insights or hints when needed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    By the end, you‚Äôll have discovered the working, time
                    complexity, and use cases through your own reasoning.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  üöÄ Why It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Traditional methods often rely on passive consumption.
                  Socratic AI flips that model‚Äîmaking you an active participant
                  in your learning journey. This leads to:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                  <li>Better retention and conceptual clarity.</li>
                  <li>Confidence in articulating algorithmic thinking.</li>
                  <li>A more engaging and personalized learning experience.</li>
                </ul>
